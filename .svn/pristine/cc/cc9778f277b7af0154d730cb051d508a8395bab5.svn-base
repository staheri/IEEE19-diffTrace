\section{Evaluation methodology}
We executed all of our experiments on TACC supercomputer (Stampede)\cite{tacc-url} . Each computing node on Stampede has two Xeon E5-2680 8-core Sandy Bridge processors.\\

We evaluated our tool on The NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) \cite{nas}. NPB has a variety of applications, like \textit{Conjugate Gradient} (cg) with irregular memory accesss and communication and \textit{Lower-Upper} (lu) a Gauss-Seidel solver.
All NPB applications have been compiled with MVAPICH2.2.1 and -g and -O1 optimization flag.

We designed our experimental evaluation  with focus on scalability and efficiency of \parlot. We executed \parlot and some other similar tools like Callgrind on NPB applications on up to 1024 cores.
