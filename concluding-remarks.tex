make sure you mention one sentence about  this that the intro
says:

\begin{verbatim}
Section \ref{sec:concl}
concludes the paper with a summary and future work that
includes the construction of verification tools
which exploit ParLoT traces.
\end{verbatim}


\begin{itemize}
\item idea of tracing for debugging
\item collecting informative data while adding less overhead 
\item no recompilation, no source code modification, portable
\item Compressing traces on-fly incrementally saves system bandwidth for application
\item most of added overhead is caused by Pin-init
\item Future work
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Generated traces from \parlot can be used for offline analysis, process/thread equivalent classes,
	\item Generated traces from \parlot can definitely show control-flow divergence among threads/processes on parallel platform
	\item Trying our compression scheme on a DBI with lower overhead than PIN
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
