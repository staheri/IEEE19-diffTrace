DiffTrace is the first tool we know of that (1)~situates debugging around {\em whole program}
diffing, (2)~provides user-selectable front-end filters of function calls to keep,
(3)~summarizes loops based on state-of-the-art algorithms to detect loop-level
behavioral differences,
(3)~summarizes the loop-summarized
traces around concept lattices that have been realized using incremental
algorithms, (4)~clusters behaviors using hierarchical clustering and ranks as per similarity,
and (5)~presents salient differences
