DiffTrace is the first tool we know of that situates debugging around {\em whole program}
diffing, provides user-selectable front-end filters of function calls to keep,
summarizes loops based on state-of-the-art algorithms to detect loop-level
behavioral differences,
summarizes the loop-summarized
traces around concept lattices that have been realized using incremental
algorithms, clusters behaviors using hierarchical clustering and ranks as per similarity,
and presents salient differences.
%
We deliberately chose the path of a clean start that addresses missing features
in existing tools and missing collectivism in the debugging community.
%
Our initial assessment of our design presented in this paper is encouraging.


Scalability, parameterization, and machine learning are our three remaining major tasks.
%
Debugging is always scalability-challenged because of growing application-scale.
%
Modularity and scalability can be achieved by handing off detailed debugging from
DiffTrace to specialized tools such as Archer~\cite{archer} that
our group has developed, and finds use within actual DOE lab projects.
%
One can gain scalability by further developing DiffTrace's mechanisms to filter function
calls, improve on ParLoT's compression methods, and discovering semantic clustering
methods that are tuned to the bug class being worked on.
%
We plan to research the role machine learning can play by taking concept lattices
and loop structures as elevated features, and conduct systematic bug-injection
studies to see whether bug classifications can be computed with high precision
and recall.
%
Our one-year plans are to take up more challenging examples, beginning with DOE miniapps,
stabilize DiffTrace, and release it to the community.
