We present a tool
DiffTrace that approaches debugging via {\em whole program} tracing and
diffing of normal and erroneous traces.
%
After collecting these traces,
a user-configurable front-end filters out irrelevant function calls,
and then summarizes loops of executions of the retained function
calls based on state-of-the-art loop extraction algorithms.
%
Information about these loops is inserted 
into concept lattices, which helps
computes salient dissimilarities to help narrow down bugs.
%
DiffTrace is a clean start that addresses many
debugging features missing in existing approaches.
%
Our experiments on a heterogeneous MPI/OpenMP program called
ILCS and initial measurements on LULESH, a DOE miniapp,
helps demonstrate the advantages of the proposed debugging approach.
