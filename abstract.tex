The need for efficient tracing to gain insight into
HPC application executions is growing. 
%
Unfortunately, available tools either do not produce traces with enough details,
or incur huge overheads.
%
An efficient  tracing method that overcomes the trade off
between maximum information and minimum overhead
is needed for today's HPC application developers.
% 

In this paper, we present \parlot, a tool that provides several key
features (1)~It dynamically instruments the binary without source-code modification or recompilation.
%
(2)~It employs a set of highly efficient trace compression methods that reduces the trace volume gathered at runtime dramatically, thus making tracing cheaper.
%
(3)~It supports program analysis and debugging by
including caller/callee
relations, call frequencies, and a linear trace of entire executions
at the granularity the user opts for.
%
This paper establishes that comparable capabilities are 
unavailable by evaluating the best alternative tracing options
on runs up to 1,024 cores on the NAS parallel benchmarks on the
Comet supercomputer.
%
Our experiments show that \parlot can produce whole-program function 
call traces with average of 56 kB/s required bandwidth while 
slowing down applications by 2.7x on average.
