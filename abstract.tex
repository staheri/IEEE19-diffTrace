The need for efficient tracing to gain insight into
HPC application executions is growing. 
%
Unfortunately, available tools either do not produce traces with enough details,
or incur huge overheads.
%
An efficient  tracing method that overcomes the trade off
between maximum information and minimum overhead
is needed for today's HPC application developers.
% 
In this paper, we present \parlot, a tool that provides several key
features (1)~It dynamically instruments the binary without source-code modification or recompilation.
%
(2)~It employs a set of highly efficient trace compression methods that reduces the trace volume gathered at runtime dramatically, thus making tracing cheaper.
%
(3)~It supports program analysis and debugging by
including caller/callee
relations, call frequencies, and a linear trace of entire executions
at various granularities.
%
(4)~It presents technique that makes low-overhead on-the-fly compression of whole-program call traces possible
%
This paper establishes that comparable capabilities are 
unavailable by evaluating the best alternative tracing options for runs on the NAS parallel benchmarks on the
Comet supercomputer using up to 1,024 cores.
%
Our experiments show that \parlot can produce whole-program function-call
traces with an average bandwidth of just 56 kB/s per core while 
slowing down the applications by 2.7x on average.
